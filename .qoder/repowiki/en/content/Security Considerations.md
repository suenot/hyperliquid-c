## Secure Private Key Handling

The hyperliquid-c library implements several security measures for private key management. Private keys are stored in client structures with fixed-size buffers, and proper memory cleanup is performed during client destruction. The library provides secure memory handling through zeroization of private key data before freeing memory, preventing potential exposure through memory dumps.

Environment variables are used as the recommended method for private key injection, as demonstrated in the example code. This approach avoids hardcoding sensitive credentials in source code and allows for secure secret management in production environments. The library does not implement additional memory protection features like mlock() to prevent swapping, so deployment environments should ensure adequate memory protection.

Sensitive data logging is controlled through conditional compilation flags. The DEBUG macro governs verbose logging output, and production builds should be compiled without this flag to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive information in log files.

## Replay Attack Protection

The hyperliquid-c library relies on the Hyperliquid exchange's built-in mechanisms for replay attack protection rather than implementing client-side nonce management. Cryptographic signatures for trading operations follow the EIP-712 standard, which includes domain separation and structured hashing to prevent signature reuse across different contexts.

The EIP-712 implementation includes domain hashing with chain ID and verifying contract information, ensuring that signatures are specific to the Hyperliquid ecosystem. This approach provides inherent protection against replay attacks across different blockchain networks or applications. The signing process incorporates the message content directly into the hash, making each signature unique to the specific transaction parameters.

For order operations, the exchange server is responsible for maintaining sequence integrity and preventing duplicate order submissions. Clients should handle idempotency at the application layer when required by using unique client order IDs.

## Secure Compilation Practices

The library's Makefile implements several security-focused compilation practices. The build system uses modern C standards (C11) with strict warning flags (-Wall, -Wextra, -Werror) to catch potential security issues during compilation. Production builds are optimized for performance with -O3, while debug builds include AddressSanitizer and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer for comprehensive runtime checking.

The build configuration includes Position Independent Code (PIC) support through the -fPIC flag, enabling safe shared library usage in ASLR-enabled environments. The Makefile also supports static analysis through cppcheck and memory leak detection via valgrind, providing tools for identifying security vulnerabilities.

Dependency management is handled through explicit linking of required libraries, including security-critical components like OpenSSL for TLS operations and libsecp256k1 for cryptographic operations. The build system does not support dynamic feature toggling, ensuring consistent security properties across builds.

## Third-Party Dependency Security

The hyperliquid-c library depends on several third-party libraries with security implications. libcurl is used for HTTP operations and is configured with secure defaults, including SSL certificate verification (CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER and CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST). The library uses curl's global initialization with default options, relying on the system's certificate store for trust management.

libsecp256k1 provides ECDSA cryptographic operations and is used for EIP-712 compliant signing. The library implements proper context management and uses deterministic nonce generation (RFC 6979) to prevent private key exposure through signature malleability.

Other dependencies include cjson for JSON parsing, OpenSSL for cryptographic operations and TLS, libmsgpackc for binary serialization, and pthread for thread safety. The build system does not implement dependency version pinning, so users should ensure they are using up-to-date versions of these libraries with known security patches applied.

## Secure Deployment Patterns

The library supports secure deployment through several mechanisms. Network security is implemented via HTTPS for all API communications, with certificate validation enabled by default. The HTTP client supports proxy configuration, allowing deployment in environments with restricted network access.

Access controls are managed at the application level through API key and private key authentication. The client structure maintains separate credentials for different authentication methods, and proper cleanup is performed on client destruction. Thread safety is provided through pthread mutexes for shared client instances.

The library does not implement built-in rate limiting, so applications should implement appropriate throttling to prevent account lockout or abuse. For high-availability deployments, clients should implement connection retry logic with exponential backoff for handling transient network failures.

## Audit Logging Best Practices

The library implements a simple logging system that balances diagnostic needs with security considerations. Logging is controlled through conditional compilation, with DEBUG builds enabling verbose output and production builds limiting output to essential information. The logging macros distinguish between different severity levels, allowing administrators to configure appropriate verbosity.

To prevent sensitive data exposure, the library avoids logging private keys, API secrets, or signed messages. Error messages are designed to provide sufficient diagnostic information without revealing implementation details that could aid attackers. The logging system writes to standard output and error streams, allowing system administrators to redirect output to secure logging infrastructure.

Applications using the library should implement additional audit logging at the business logic level, capturing high-level operations like order submissions and cancellations without including sensitive parameters. Log rotation and retention policies should be established in accordance with organizational security requirements.
