## Performance and Security

The Hyperliquid C SDK has been designed with performance and security as core principles, ensuring it meets the requirements of high-frequency trading applications and production environments.

**Performance Characteristics:**
- Optimized for high-frequency trading with <100ms latency
- Efficient JSON parsing with cJSON library
- Fast MessagePack serialization with correct field ordering
- Memory-efficient data structures with dynamic allocation
- Thread-safe operations using pthread mutexes
- Cross-platform support for Linux, macOS, and Windows
- Build system with Make for easy compilation

**Security Features:**
- EIP-712 signing for all private endpoints using libsecp256k1
- Correct recovery ID calculation by comparing all 4 possible recovery IDs against the expected Ethereum address
- HTTPS/WSS only for all communications
- Private keys never exposed in memory or logs
- Comprehensive error handling with detailed error codes
- Secure private key storage framework with memory locking
- Production-quality memory management with proper cleanup

**Critical Implementation Notes:**
The SDK implements two critical requirements discovered through extensive debugging with reference SDKs:

1. **MessagePack Field Ordering**: The Hyperliquid API requires exact field ordering in MessagePack serialization. The order object must be serialized as `a → b → p → s → r → t` (asset_id, is_buy, price, size, reduce_only, order_type), with "s" before "r" being critical. The order action must be `type → orders → grouping` with "type" first. Changing the order results in different MessagePack bytes, which leads to different action hashes and signatures that are rejected by the API.

2. **EIP-712 Signing**: The recovery ID (v value) must be calculated correctly by deriving the public key from the private key, computing the expected Ethereum address, trying all 4 recovery IDs (0-3), finding which one recovers to the correct address, and setting v = recovery_id + 27. This was the key fix that made Hyperliquid orders work.

The SDK has been validated against Go, Rust, and Python SDKs with byte-for-byte comparison confirming identical MessagePack output and EIP-712 signatures.

## Migration Guidance

For users upgrading from previous versions or migrating from other SDKs, the Hyperliquid C SDK provides a clean, well-documented API with comprehensive examples and backward compatibility considerations.

**From Previous Versions:**
The SDK has maintained API stability throughout its development, with no breaking changes reported in the release history. Users can upgrade to the latest version with confidence that existing code will continue to function.

**From Other SDKs:**
The CCXT-compatible architecture makes migration from other CCXT-based implementations straightforward. The `describe()` function and capabilities structure ensure that the SDK can be integrated into existing CCXT workflows with minimal changes.

**Key Integration Points:**
- Client creation with `hl_client_create()` requires wallet address, private key, and testnet flag
- All API functions use the client handle as the first parameter
- Memory management functions (e.g., `hl_free_orders()`, `hl_free_trades()`) must be called to prevent memory leaks
- Error codes should be checked for all function calls
- The mutex in the client structure ensures thread safety for concurrent operations

**Example Migration Pattern:**
```c
// Create client
hl_client_t* client = hl_client_create("0x...", "private_key", true);

// Fetch balance
hl_balance_t balance;
hl_error_t error = hl_fetch_balance(client, &balance);
if (error != HL_SUCCESS) {
    // Handle error
}

// Clean up
hl_client_destroy(client);
```

**Best Practices:**
- Always check return error codes
- Use the provided memory cleanup functions
- Implement proper error handling for network and API errors
- Use the testnet for initial integration testing
- Monitor for updates to complete the remaining CCXT methods
