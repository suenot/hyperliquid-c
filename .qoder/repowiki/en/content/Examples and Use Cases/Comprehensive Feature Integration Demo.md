## Performance Considerations
The comprehensive_demo.c example demonstrates several performance considerations that are important for production trading applications. The SDK is designed for high-frequency trading with typical REST API latency under 100ms and memory efficiency of approximately 50KB per client instance. The implementation is thread-safe, supporting concurrent operations, and includes connection pooling to reuse client instances. The SDK respects exchange rate limits with a default 50ms delay between requests and includes automatic retry with backoff for error recovery. These performance characteristics make the SDK suitable for algorithmic trading bots, high-frequency trading systems, and other applications that require low latency and high reliability.
